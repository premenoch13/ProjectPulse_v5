/* ============================================================
    POWER AUTOMATE FLOW INTEGRATION — shared by App.jsx and
    ProjectAllocation.jsx. Pulled into its own file so both can
    import it without a circular import between the two.

    Real HTTP-triggered flow. In dev, calls go through the Vite
    proxy path "/flow" (see vite.config.js) to avoid CORS; in
    production point this at your own proxy/Azure Function.

    ONE flow serves every master-data module via an "entity"
    switch. Trigger schema was extended (Sept 2026) to add:
    email, reportingManagerId, locationId (User); zohoProjectId,
    projectManagerUserId, deliveryHeadUserId, projectDepartmentId,
    currencyId, projectValue, geography, poNumber, sowReference,
    remarks, projectStatusId, approvalStatusId (Project);
    designationId, resourceDepartmentId (ProjectResource);
    countryCurrencyId (Country); pipelineCode, opportunityName,
    projectType, pipelineBillingTypeId, pipelineCurrencyId,
    expectedStartDate, durationMonths, probabilityPct, priority,
    pipelineGeography, pipelineRemarks, convertedToProjectId
    (PipelineProject). See flow1's live trigger for the exact
    current schema — this comment is a summary, not the source
    of truth.

    ENTITY VALUES (must match exactly — case-sensitive, checked
    against the flow's outer Switch_on_Entity "case" values):
      "Department" | "Country" | "ProjectCategory" | "Role" |
      "DealStatus" | "BillingType" | "Client" | "ClientContacts" |
      "User" | "Project" | "ProjectResource" | "ApprovalStatus" |
      "ProjectStatus" | "UserRoles" | "InvoiceStatus" | "PipelineProject" |
      "ProjectResourceTxn"

    RESPONSE SHAPES (what each entity's Select action actually
    returns — these are NOT uniform, so each wrapper below reads
    the exact keys its own flow branch produces):
      Department      -> "Department Code","Department Name","Status","guid"
      Country         -> "CountryCode","CountryName","IsActive","guid","currencyId"
      ProjectCategory -> "CategoryCode","CategoryName","IsActive","guid"
      Role            -> "RoleCode","RoleName","IsActive","guid"
      DealStatus      -> "guid","name","active"                 (no code)
      BillingType     -> "guid","code","name","active"
      Client          -> "guid","clientCode","clientName","countryId","active"
      ClientContacts  -> "guid","clientId","contactName","contactEmail","contactPhone","active"
      User            -> "UserID","EmpID","FirstName","LastName","Gender","JobTitle","DepartmentID","IsActive","Email","ReportingManagerId","LocationId"
      Project         -> "guid","projectCode","projectName","categoryId","clientId","billingTypeId","dealStatusId","startDate","endDate","active", + zohoProjectId/projectManagerUserId/deliveryHeadUserId/projectDepartmentId/currencyId/projectValue/geography/poNumber/sowReference/remarks/projectStatusId/approvalStatusId
      ProjectResource -> "guid","projectId","userId","roleId","allocationPct","weeklyHours","billable","startDate","endDate","designationId","resourceDepartmentId"
      ApprovalStatus  -> "guid","ApprovalStatusCode","ApprovalStatusName","IsActive"   (guid = the table's int "Id" column, NOT the Guid uniqueidentifier column)
      ProjectStatus   -> "guid","ProjectStatusCode","ProjectStatusName","IsActive"     (same "Id"-as-guid convention)
      UserRoles       -> "guid","userId","roleId","active"                             (guid = "Id"; junction row between Users and Roles)
      InvoiceStatus   -> "guid","InvoiceStatusCode","InvoiceStatusName","IsActive"     (guid = "InvoiceStatusId"; table + flow branch both live)
      PipelineProject -> "guid","projectName","clientId","dealValue","dealStatusId","expectedCloseDate","ownerUserId","active", + pipelineCode/opportunityName/projectManagerUserId/deliveryHeadUserId/pipelineDepartmentId/projectType/pipelineBillingTypeId/pipelineCurrencyId/expectedStartDate/durationMonths/probabilityPct/priority/pipelineGeography/pipelineRemarks/convertedToProjectId   (guid = "PipelineProjectId")
      ProjectResourceTxn -> "guid","projectId","userId","roleId","startDate","endDate","allocationPct","active"   (guid = "ProjectResourceTxnId"; history/log table, distinct from ProjectResource)
      Billing (flow2) -> "guid","projectId","billingPeriodId","billingTypeId","amount","currencyId","milestoneName","submittedByUserId","approvalStatusId","approvedByUserId","approvedOn","remarks","active"

    LIST RESPONSE CACHE — every screen used to hit the flow again
    on every mount (open Department, leave, come back — another
    round trip), which is what made navigation feel slow. Since
    every wrapper below funnels through this one function, caching
    here covers all of them with no changes needed anywhere else.

    Rules:
      - A "LIST" call for an entity already in cache is answered
        INSTANTLY from cache — the caller never waits on the network,
        even if the entry has gone stale (see below). Two components
        asking for the same entity at the same time (e.g. the
        Dashboard and a page mounting together) share one in-flight
        request instead of firing two.
      - If the cached entry is older than LIST_CACHE_TTL_MS, a fresh
        copy is fetched silently in the background to update the
        cache for the *next* request — the current caller still gets
        the fast (slightly older) answer immediately, never a wait.
      - Any non-LIST call (CREATE/EDIT/DELETE) for an entity drops
        that entity's cached list, so the very next LIST refetches
        current data instead of showing something stale.

  AUTH FLOW — entity="Auth" on flow2 (NEW_FLOW_URL). New branch,
  additive only — does not touch any existing entity case.

  Actions:
    GET_CREDENTIAL   { username } -> the one matching UserCredential
                       row (if any), INCLUDING PasswordHash. The
                       hash never gets compared server-side because
                       Power Automate has no bcrypt action — it's
                       compared in the browser with bcryptjs
                       (see pages/auth/SignInPage.jsx). This means
                       a hash briefly crosses the network on every
                       login attempt; acceptable only because this
                       app sits behind your own auth wall/VPN — if
                       it's ever exposed publicly, move this check
                       into a real backend instead.
    CREATE_CREDENTIAL { userId, username, passwordHashB64 } -> inserts
                       a new UserCredential row. passwordHashB64 is
                       the bcrypt hash bytes, base64-encoded (Power
                       Automate's SQL connector expects base64 for
                       varbinary columns, not hex).
    REQUEST_RESET     { username } -> creates a PasswordResetToken
                       row (random token generated client-side,
                       expiring in 30 min) and returns it. No email
                       step is wired up (no email connector in this
                       flow) — the UI shows the reset link directly,
                       which only really works for an admin resetting
                       a colleague's password face-to-face/over chat;

                       REQUEST_RESET branch before relying on this
                       for real self-service resets.
    CONFIRM_RESET     { token, passwordHashB64 } -> flow's own SQL
                       validates the token (unused, unexpired) before
                       updating PasswordHash and marking the token

                       WHERE clause; do not trust an unexpired flag
