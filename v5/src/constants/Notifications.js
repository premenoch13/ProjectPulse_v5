// "requestedBy") — recipientResolver.js turns those into actual DB emails
// (Users.Email, via Project.ProjectManagerUserId/DeliveryHeadUserId,
// ProjectResource/Timesheet.UserID, Users.ReportingManagerId, and the
// Finance/Management ROLE via UserRoles/Roles), per FSD 4.5's "Notification
// recipients shall be determined based on Project Manager, Practice Head,
// Delivery Head, resource, Finance user, or configured distribution list."
//
// Both mails (Audit team, business-event) still go through the SAME
// /auditflow flow (see utils/mail.js) — only to/cc/subject/body differ.

// user's own module permissions. There used to be a REQUIRE_MAIL_PERMISSION
